- **Sutures**:
  - Nonabsorbable, strong silk or nylon suture (e.g., 0 or 1-0)
- **Scalpel**:
  - Size 11 blade
- **Chest tube** (for surgical tube thoracostomy):
  - Sizes range from 16 to 36 French (Fr), depending on intended use
    - **20 to 24 Fr**: For pneumothorax or malignant pleural effusion
    - **28 to 36 Fr**: For complicated parapneumonic effusions, empyema, bronchopleural fistula
    - **32 to 36 Fr**: For hemothorax
- **Thoracostomy catheter (pigtail catheter)** (for catheter thoracostomy):
  - ≤14 Fr
- **Suction device**
- **Water seal drainage apparatus and connecting tubing**

**Hazard:** Ensure all equipment is sterile to prevent infection.

**Step 2: Review additional considerations and relevant anatomy.**

- **Expertise required**:
  - Procedure should be performed by a physician trained in chest tube insertion.
- **Inpatient procedure**:
  - Chest tube placement requires hospital admission.
- **Catheter selection**:
  - Use smaller diameter catheters (≤14 Fr) for pneumothoraces or free-flowing effusions.
  - Use larger diameter tubes for purulent effusions and hemothoraces to prevent clogging and kinking.
- **Pain management**:
  - Smaller catheters cause less pain and may not require sutures after removal.
- **Relevant anatomy**:
  - **Neurovascular bundles** are located at the lower edge of each rib.
  - **Critical point**: The tube must be placed over the upper edge of the rib to avoid damaging the neurovascular bundle.

**Hazard:** Misplacement can cause injury to neurovascular structures, leading to bleeding or intercostal neuralgia.

#### Patient Positioning

**Step 3: Position the patient with the head of the bed elevated at 30 to 60 degrees.**

- **Purpose**: Limits diaphragm elevation during expiration, reducing the risk of inadvertent intra-abdominal tube placement.

**Step 4: Position the patient's arm on the affected side.**

- **Options**:
  - Place the arm over the patient's head or abducted to expose the lateral chest wall.
  - Alternatively, have the patient place their hand behind their head.

#### Procedure Steps

##### Preparation

**Step 5: Connect the water seal suction apparatus to a suction source.**

- **Equipment**: Ensure it is sealed with sterile water and connected using appropriate tubing.
- **Hazard**: The apparatus must be kept 100 cm (40 inches) below the patient to prevent retrograde flow of air or fluid into the pleural space.

**Step 6: Select and mark the insertion site.**

- **For pneumothorax**:
  - 4th intercostal space at the mid-axillary or anterior axillary line.
- **For other indications**:
  - 5th intercostal space at the mid-axillary or anterior axillary line.
- **Tip**: Use a skin marking pen or make an impression with a pen before skin preparation.

**Step 7: Prepare the insertion site with an antiseptic solution.**

- **Equipment**: Use 2% chlorhexidine solution.
- **Hazard**: Ensure thorough cleansing to prevent infection.

**Step 8: Drape the area with sterile drapes to maintain a sterile field.**

##### Anesthesia

**Step 9: Administer local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine.**

- **Equipment**:
  - 25-gauge needle for skin infiltration.
  - 21-gauge needle for deeper tissues.
- **Procedure**:
  - Inject into the skin, subcutaneous tissue, rib periosteum (of the rib below the insertion site), and parietal pleura.
  - Use generous amounts around the highly pain-sensitive periosteum and parietal pleura.
- **Hazard**: Aspirate before injecting to avoid intravascular injection.
- **Confirmation**: Entry into the pleural space is confirmed by aspiration of air (in pneumothorax) or fluid (in effusion).

**Step 10: Estimate the insertion depth for the chest tube or catheter.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Ensure all side holes of the tube or catheter will be inside the pleural space.
  - Account for subcutaneous fat, especially in obese patients.
- **Action**: Note or record the depth on the tube or catheter that should align with the skin upon insertion.

##### Chest Tube Placement (≥16 Fr)

**Step 11: Make a 1.5 to 2 cm skin incision over the selected intercostal space.**

- **Equipment**: Use a size 11 scalpel blade.
- **Hazard**: Avoid cutting too deeply to prevent injury to underlying structures like muscles or blood vessels.

**Step 12: Bluntly dissect through subcutaneous tissue to the pleura.**

- **Equipment**: Use a hemostat or Kelly clamp.
- **Procedure**:
  - Advance the instrument over the upper edge of the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle.
  - Open the instrument to dissect tissue and create a tract.
- **Hazard**: Be cautious of the neurovascular bundle below each rib to prevent bleeding or nerve damage.

**Step 13: Perforate the parietal pleura.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Use the hemostat or finger to gently penetrate the pleura.
  - Feel for a "pop" or decrease in resistance indicating entry into the pleural space.
- **Hazard**: Avoid injuring the lung parenchyma or other intrathoracic structures.

**Step 14: Use a finger to widen the tract and explore the pleural space.**

- **Purpose**:
  - Confirm entry into the pleural space.
  - Check for adhesions or other abnormalities.
- **Hazard**: Ensure sterility to prevent infection; avoid sharp objects that could damage tissues.

**Step 15: Clamp the chest tube at the distal end to prevent air entry.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Use a hemostat to clamp the end of the chest tube that remains outside the patient.

**Step 16: Insert the chest tube through the tract into the pleural space.**

- **Procedure**:
  - For effusions: Direct the tube inferoposteriorly.
  - For pneumothorax: Direct the tube apically (upwards).
  - Advance the tube until all side holes are within the pleural cavity.
- **Hazard**: Avoid forceful insertion to prevent tissue damage; ensure the tube is not coiled or kinked inside the chest.

##### Chest Catheter Placement (≤14 Fr)

**Step 17: Insert the needle along the upper border of the rib while aspirating.**

- **Equipment**: Appropriate needle and syringe.
- **Procedure**:
  - Insert the needle slowly while aspirating.
  - Advance until fluid or air is aspirated, indicating entry into the pleural space.
- **Hazard**: Avoid puncturing underlying organs such as the lung or diaphragm.

**Step 18: Insert the guidewire into the pleural space through the needle.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Remove the syringe, leaving the needle in place.
  - Pass the guidewire smoothly through the needle.
- **Hazard**: Ensure the guidewire passes without resistance; do not force it.

**Step 19: Remove the needle, leaving the guidewire in place.**

**Step 20: Make a small skin incision at the insertion site.**

- **Equipment**: Use a scalpel.
- **Procedure**:
  - Make a nick in the skin to facilitate passage of the dilator and catheter.
- **Hazard**: Make the incision just large enough to allow passage; avoid excessive cutting.

**Step 21: Pass the dilator over the guidewire into the pleural space.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Gently advance the dilator to widen the tract.
- **Hazard**: Do not over-dilate; excessive force can cause tissue damage.

**Step 22: Place the catheter and its trocar over the guidewire into the pleural space.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Ensure the last side hole of the catheter is within the pleural space.
  - Remove the guidewire and trocar, leaving the catheter in place.
- **Hazard**: Avoid kinking the catheter; ensure it is properly positioned.

##### Securing the Tube/Catheter

**Step 23: Suture the chest tube or catheter to the skin.**

- **Equipment**: Nonabsorbable silk or nylon suture (0 or 1-0).
- **Procedure**:
  - Use a purse-string suture or interrupted sutures to secure the tube.
- **Hazard**: Secure firmly to prevent dislodgement but avoid excessive tension that can cause skin necrosis.

**Step 24: Apply a sterile dressing around the insertion site.**

- **Equipment**:
  - Petroleum gauze
  - Sterile gauze pads
- **Procedure**:
  - Place petroleum gauze around the tube to seal the wound.
  - Cut two sterile gauze pads halfway and place them around the tube.
- **Hazard**: Ensure dressing is secure and sterile to prevent infection.

**Step 25: Remove the drapes carefully to maintain sterility.**

**Step 26: Tape the dressing in place using pressure dressings.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Use tape to secure the dressing.
  - For added stability, tape the external part of the tube to the dressing or patient's skin.
- **Hazard**: Avoid constricting circulation; ensure the tube is not kinked.

##### Connecting to Suction

**Step 27: Connect the tube or catheter to the water seal suction apparatus.**

- **Purpose**: Prevent air from entering the chest and allow for effective drainage.
- **Procedure**:
  - Ensure all connections are tight and secure.
- **Hazard**: Leaks can compromise the effectiveness of the drainage system.

#### Aftercare for Surgical Tube and Catheter Thoracostomy

**Step 28: Obtain an anteroposterior chest X-ray at the bedside.**

- **Purpose**: Verify the position of the tube or catheter and ensure proper lung expansion.
- **Hazard**: If malpositioned, repositioning may be necessary under sterile conditions to prevent complications.

**Step 29: Monitor the patient for any complications.**

- **Signs to watch for**:
  - Respiratory distress
  - Signs of infection (fever, increased white blood cell count)
  - Subcutaneous emphysema
  - Excessive drainage or bleeding
- **Hazard**: Early detection of complications is critical for prompt management.

**Step 30: Manage drainage appropriately.**

- **For pneumothorax**:
  - Suction may be stopped once the air leak has ceased, and the lung is fully expanded.
  - Place on water seal for several hours before removal.
- **For pleural effusions or hemothorax**:
  - Consider tube removal when drainage is less than 100 to 200 mL/day of serous fluid.
- **Hazard**: Draining more than 1.5 liters of fluid at once may risk re-expansion pulmonary edema.

#### Removal of Chest Tube/Catheter

**Step 31: Prepare for removal once the condition has resolved.**

- **Consultation**:
  - For patients on mechanical ventilation or with high-risk factors, consult a pulmonary specialist before removal.

**Step 32: Remove the tube or catheter carefully.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Position the patient semi-upright.
  - Remove sutures securing the tube or catheter.
  - Ask the patient to take a deep breath and then forcibly exhale.
  - Remove the tube or catheter swiftly during exhalation.
  - Immediately cover the site with petroleum gauze to prevent air entry.
- **Hazard**: Risk of pneumothorax if the site is not sealed promptly after removal.

**Step 33: Close the incision site.**

- **Procedure**:
  - Tighten the purse-string suture if used.
  - Apply additional sutures if necessary to close the incision.
- **Hazard**: Ensure proper closure to prevent infection or air leaks.

**Step 34: Obtain a chest X-ray several hours after removal.**

- **Purpose**: Confirm that no pneumothorax or other complications have developed.
- **Hazard**: Delayed pneumothorax can occur; continued monitoring is essential.

#### Warnings and Common Errors

**Step 35: Be aware of warnings and common errors.**

- **Do not use small chest catheters (≤14 Fr) for bloody effusions**:
  - Clots can clog the catheter, leading to ineffective drainage.
- **Ensure the water seal suction apparatus remains below the patient**:
  - Prevents backflow into the pleural space.
- **Re-expansion pulmonary edema**:
  - Be cautious when draining large volumes; monitor the patient closely.
- **Incorrect tube positioning**:
  - If side holes are outside the chest cavity, the tube must be replaced using sterile technique.
  - Simply advancing the tube is not acceptable due to contamination risks.
- **Common insertion errors**:
  - Inadequate local anesthetic administration.
